# ExtandableListView Project

A view that shows items in a vertically scrolling two-level list. This differs from the ListView by allowing two levels: groups which can individually be expanded to show its children. The items come from the ExpandableListAdapter associated with this view.Certainly, I wanted to share a simple example of the ExpandableListView with you. You can review it below.
